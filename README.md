This is a repository for E-commerce React.Js

It is developed to create a soothing Experience with powerful features and clean interface.

Problem Statement :- Create a React application with a list of products and implement search and filters on it.

Features
1. Search Page
a. Either create 30-40 dummy products or get these products from some fake
API.
b. Display 10 products at a time on the search page. For showing rest you can
either implement pagination or infinite scroll (like Facebook, where you scroll
and the next 10 products will load up). DONâ€™T USE ANY LIBRARY FOR THIS.
c. Create search, users should be able to search in all 30-40 products using the
search bar at the top.
d. Filters: user should be able to use the following filters to filter the products
i. Category (Mens, Womens, Kids)
ii. Price
iii. Brand
iv. Color
Remember users can apply multiple filters at a time and also users can apply
filters only on searched products as well. Keep this case in mind.
